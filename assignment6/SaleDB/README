To create the tables and populate them, just log on to 
the oracle database using sqlplus, and run the BUILD.sql
file once you get the SQL> prompt :

 SQL> @BUILD

That's all you need. 

Note that the first time you do this, you will get warnings
that the tables don't exist (the BUILD.sql script destroys
everything, and then rebuilds the whole thing). The warnings
are not a problem at all.

Notice the tree structure of how the scripts call each other.

Note: this version of the scripts does not include any constraints.
